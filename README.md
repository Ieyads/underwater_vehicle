# Underwater Vehicle

This repository provides instructions on how to setup and build the software of the AUV.

# Operating System

In this case, Linux Ubuntu version 22.04 was used for the development of the vehicle.

# Setup

First step: Your choice of using Ubuntu is really important and you have the following options:

1. Booting Ubuntu on a virtual machine — easier and recommended  
2. Dual booting on your machine — if you have experience with Linux  
3. Using Linux as your main operating system for your machine  

**Note:** In this guide, Ubuntu is running on a virtual machine.

# Virtual Machine

You have the following options:

1. VirtualBox  
2. VMware  

**Note:** In this case, VirtualBox is used. You can download it from the following link:
